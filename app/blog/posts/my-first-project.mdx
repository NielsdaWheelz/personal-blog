* I made a go app.
* I didn't actually know the rules when I started. Then when I learned them the logic behind it seem impossible.
* I had to learn not to try to build the whole app in my head - trying to hold all of the logic in my head at once seemed impossible. But once I started just taking it step-by-step, trying to figure out the next piece of data I needed, it all came together pretty easily.
* I was pretty proud of the logic when I finished (both the game rules and how I built the board). The way I got it to work was very clever minimal.
* By the end of the week it all seemed pretty quaint tho. It's frustrating to grow, isn't it.
* React query was weird at the beginning, but pretty easy by the end once I figured out the... pattern, or format, or structure, or whatever - what to put where, and why.
* Same thing with sockets - weird at first, fine at the end.
* the rest of the time was wasted on styling. eugh. no vision for what it should look like resulted in a pretty lacklustre show. And learning that tailwind has a default enforced minimum height but NOT a minimim width took a _long_ time.
* The presentation was ok. I did but better than I thought I would, in terms of not having a panick attack, not mumbling, etc.
* But I probably should have gone over the actually interesting and difficult parts in the logic and board rendering, the stuff I found interesting. Perhaps that's the lesson there.
