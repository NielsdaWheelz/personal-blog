* a very big week
* working in a group is hard
* learned the hard lesson of the necessity of typing and clean, organized, clear code
* also learned the hard lesson of the costs of being a cowboy and making vast sweeping changes to a codebase that is no longer just mine
* permissions is fucking impossible. the complexity and the edge cases broke my brain. I should have sought help sooner. i should have worked smarter, broken it down into small achievable chunks.
* creating highlights was a fascinating problem with even more fascinating solutions. Nyan did unbelievable work on it. his ability and drive continue to amaze me.
* Jahnik did an unreal job keeping us focused, organized, and optimistic (especially when Nyan and I were a little frustrated and down). His tireless work corralling our adventures, solving our conflicts, and helping each of us with whatever we were struggling with made the team work. None of this would have worked without him. He kept the good times rolling.
* I am proud and lucky to have worked with both of them.
* I was surprised. I never thought Paris thought that much of me - but he's not really an effusive guy. I am surprised they didn't go to Nyan or one of the others first. Why did they choose me?
* I think they appreciated my drive. Not many work as hard, or have as little (A.K.A. no) previous experience.
* I have drive now; I am just so glad to be here, to have hope for the future, to have an achievable plan and goal and consistent progress. 
* But will it last? What happens when I am on my own again? What happens once I leave this inspiring, invigorating, focusing environment?
* I could try to stay, spend my off hours here to work (on AI?) and read. might be best
* Could talk to them. To Mark. Explain my fears and ask for advice.
* However, when I was working in cool things in the past, I certainly never lost my drive - not until the work got boring and pointless (it was no longer cool). No reason to expect that here - not with AI anyway; I'm not sure about SupplyCo - it kinda seems pretty boring. AI will be hard to get started in the beginning tho, that might be hard to push through without a fractal environment.
* I am nervous, scared, and absolutely terrified. I am scared I will disappoint, will not meet expectations, will struggle or fail.
* They think so highly of me, I am terrified to let them down, disappoint them, to have them think less of me.
* That's the real, sad, true core of my fear - of all my fears. I want to be safe. I need good people to like me, value me. And I am terrified of losing it if I have it, no matter how little.
* I don't think this is so evil, but that's not the problem, it's the insecurity and the desperation that cause trouble. 
* I am... cautiously excited by the idea of AI research. I cannot remember the last time I was excited about anything. 
* I had never really considered it as a possibility, and certainly never thought it within my reach.
* I don't really care about the money. All I want is however much money I need to not have to think about money, and I basically live like a monk (my biggest expense is used books)
* I'm actively antagonistic to the idea of status or fame.
* I don't have any burning desire to work at OpenAI or Anthropic or Google or something.
* But to work on something truly hard, and truly significant and real. And to be surrounded by the best, in skill, in talent, but most of all in morals. I think that's what I want most. Like working at early IBM or Bell labs or Xerox - I think there is literally nothing more appealing to me than that.
* I want to be at my limit. Whether it is also humanity's limit is kind of immaterial to me.
* I think that's part of the vast appeal of sports to me. It doesn't matter that I'm not that good in the grand scheme of things, as long as I am at the limit of what I can do, and I'm pushing to do more tomorrow, it feels fantastic.
* The meeting with Harrison went really well. He's a nice guy, and said all the right things about the people and environment.
* I'm a little worried about the work itself. I don't know how much B2B SAAS (no matter how much they spin it as robot-manufacturing-AI-whatever) can excite me.
* And if it's 50hrs/6 days a week, how much time and energy will I have for AI research?
* Would it be more valuable to continue to study? Would I get greater value working somewhere else? Am I limiting my future options by taking this? - questions for Andrew and Paris and David.
* And why did they choose me anyway? I guess they already told me, I just can't accept it.
