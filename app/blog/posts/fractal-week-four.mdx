Those hard assignments threw me for a loop. I actually struggled for almost a day.
* I was back to instantly panicking, getting overwhelmed, and blanking, like I did in the first week or two. Back then, I could ask ChatGPT to give me the most basic starting point, and that would be enough to relax me and get me started (no matter how wrong it was). Here, I could not use ChatGPT, and so was forced to work through that emotional block on my own. But as with all things, practice made it much better and easier.
* Then, in the middle of the problem, trying to progress was impossible, since it was all one big function. It is impossible to reason about, impossible to understand when it's that size. There's no sense of pieces, you have to know everything about every part. It cannot be done, no matter the mind (well, at least not by human minds).
* Everything else we've done has had a shape, a pattern. When you've seen it once, it's easy to apply elsewhere. Here, the pattern is a meta one, something about the approach to modeling complex systems, and I had not seen it. The examples I'd seen of how to approach ahd not had an explicit (meta) pattern which I could easily integrate.
To get through it, I had to take a step back.
* I rewrote assignment 2 three times after I solved it until I could articulate the goals and lessons: 1) Pure functions (I think I understand why that matters); try to reduce external changes. 2) Use "..." to create new shit, do not 'mutate' old shit. 3) Types. 4) Narrow down function scopes as far as possible, and make them follow patterns (similar-to-identical inputs and outputs). 5) A state object makes the whole thing organised and centralised.
* 1) These puzzles are just problems, and we've solved tens of hundreds of problems over the past three weeks, the only difference is I'm trying to build them all at once for some reason, instead of how we've always done it: by breaking them up into smaller ones (recursively, until irreducible). We have an input and an output, and there's always a way from A to B. It's even sometimes easier to start at B and work backwards (what shape does it need? How do I make it? What data does that need? etc.).
* 2) This stuff was all in the water already (types, pure functions, etc.), we had covered them in readings or whatever. But I think it takes real suffering at their hands in order to internalise what they are and why they're important (no junior ever values or understands Grug-Brained Developer or whatever else - I still don't). But after the suffering we must identify specifically what it was that caused the suffering.
* 3) Ask Chatty-G - not for code, but for help breaking the problem down: for section headers of a tutorial, for a guide without content, for signposts. I actually had it make a few similar problems, and then didn't try solving them completely but just tried breaking them down into miniscule, composasable parts, delaying the coding as long as possible, until I could explain every future line in English, in terms of taking and passing one small piece of data from one line to the next. To be honest I think this might be the biggest hurdle for the entire class (those of us who struggle, anyway), and is well worth both teaching and practicing. Every other failure or struggle is a symptom of this. It's just hard to notice when you're nose-deep and floundering.
* 4) I'm doing the same problem over and over until its contents are forgettable; only then do I start to see the patterns and choices behind my approach to it. It's like reading: the first time through a book, you're bogged down in plot and character and style and energy and emotion and whatever else; only the second-plus time can you start to see the structure, the flow, the choices the author made. The first time I read a book is to see if it's worth reading at all. "There is no reading, only re-reading".
* Now that I've internalised this slightly these assignment2 problems have become a _lot_ easier and faster. The slower I go, the faster I finish
* There was a lack of direction this week, which led to a lack of (felt) progress.
* There was no pressure this week. No sense of urgency, no feeling of being behind, no real need to achieve something before the end of the week.
* This let do some pretty lacklustre working days, just pumping out small features with AI slop.
* I'm not really enjoying AI coding
* What I wanted to work on kinda necessitated that I _not_ use AI, so I ended up just adding a bunch of meh features to Sidenote using AI. I'm not very good at it. I scope large and get much slop. It also encourages lazy thinking.
* It's far too easy to not think, because you often don't have to. Just throw in the most base impulse, a vague conception of a need, an unedited and un-added-to error log, and it'll handle the rest.
* But when it leaves you in a hole (like it did when setting up PDFs), suddenly you have to dig yourself out of this mess of dirt and stones and god knows what else.
* On the other hand, once I did clean it up and console-log everything, I could not have found the issue without its ability to quickly parse vast amounts of data. It would have taken me hours, and some not insignificant outside-the-box thinking.
* I think the answer is to revert to my old system of figuring out everything myself, but instead have the AI do the actual _writing_. This actually make makes me a little more excited to AI-code.
SupplyCo has been kind of an emotional rollercoaster
* first, they choose me first out of everybody
* then they tell me it's the great and famous Harrison's company, the (very nice, very cool) poster-child/legend of Fractal who 3x'ed his income
* then they tell me that the people there are great and genuinely brilliant - not at all intimidating
* then they tell me it's not an internship, but a work trial, and that they're more than willing to sponsor a visa
* then they ask me what i want to do with my life, cuz they think i can do literally whatever i want. do i want to be an AI researcher, or do I want to get a very good and high-paying job right now?
* then i meet Harrison, and he's a delight
* then they push my meeting with the founder twice
* then they get back to me and say that one of them suffered a concussion (poor girl. i feel that), and gave me some info about their work so i can learn and prepare
* I am worn out.
i'm very excited about next week
* I'm really, genuinely thrilled to be starting on building AI. It's terrifying, daunting, and truly mentally challenging in a way I haven't engaged since ... I can't remember. It's actually exciting.
* I'm nervous about learning even more new stuff for SupplyCo: fastapi, sqlModel, nextjs. The stakes are high. I have a lot of expectations to maintain. Inshallah
