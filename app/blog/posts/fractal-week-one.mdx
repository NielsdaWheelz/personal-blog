* It's been been good so far.
* A few difficult moments, but overall not too hard at all.
* 2 weeks of prep was nothing, I felt like I was going in blind. I wish I'd decided to come earlier, and so started preparing sooner.
* Not knowing how to program at all, however, was not an impediment. The program is well structured so far: it starts at nothing and builds up every day coherently.
* The 'meta' skills they try to teach seem very useful. It's clearly nascent (somewhat undirected, shapeless, unsure of itself) but it's clearly pointing towards the thought patterns (problem solving, psychology-management) necessary for this line of work.
* The instructors are excellent. No notes. Knowledgeable, capable, and willing and invested in the success of their students. They also have a good mix of personalities for teaching; patience, (seemingly) good habits, and some necessary blunt, no-bullshit feedback, which almost always absent in teaching.
* I suppose this should be more about _my_ experience.
* I dunno. Definitely learning a lot, infinitely more capable now than when I started - let's hope that continues.
* On the other hand, not super challenged or pushed. Maybe some of that is on me: I could and probably should push myself more, set higher targets, be creative and ambitious.
* But it's week 1, everyone's still getting a handle on the beginnings and on each other (students and teachers).
* Styling sucks. TBH a big part of my issue is vision: I have no taste for what could or should be. I think about what to do, I have no idea, so I just start throwing spaghetti.
* This is a broader problem: whenever I am confronted, even when confronting myself, I blank. Whether it be trying to design or write something, or when being evaluated.
* The parts I always have the most trouble with are unfamiliar libraries (socket.io, tanstack, whatever). They're always a pain to set up, and their ... syntax? ... is always weird, so it takes a while to figure out how to actually use the damn thing.
* The other students are universally nice, friendly. Mostly young, which was surprising.
* My shyness is absolutely a problem. Not knowing how to start or continue conversations keeps me separate from everyone else, and it will definitely (continue to) cripple me in the future if I don't do something about it.
