* A harder week, and a better week.
* I feel like the quantity of stuff learned is less than the first week, but the quality is much greater. I feel imbued with immense capacity: any problem I come up against, with enough time breaking down the problem, eventually it is small enough that I can solve it. The feeling of being overwhelmed whenever I come across something new is significantly decreasing.
* I worry, however, that I am over-relying on LLMs. I don't copy code, but I definitely get a lot of help outlining the problem, breaking down the solution, learning what's possible and what's out there, and am still asking extremely basic questions. It is an _immense_ boon to be able to get feedback on my strategy before I even commit it to code; it saves an _ungodly_ amount of time.
* I think I just need more practice. Jahnik - wisely, I think - said that the difference between the good coders and the rest of us is that they've written 20x the code we have. Like everything else in life, it's mostly a volume game. Write more lines of code. More more more.
* It gets lonely, in a new city, surrounded by strangers. And I'm already pretty lonely at home. Wednesday the depression was crushing, it completely disabled me. I was able to work through it a little that evening and Thursday morning, and the feeling of capability (from successfully achieving even those small things) gave me strength enough to carry on. I'd never shaken it off that quickly before, I've not always been so lucky. It's just so awful. The environment of Fractal helps: it pulls you in, makes it easier to stay focused, worked through whatever agony or distraction. That... weight is still there - I suppose it always will be, but I can carry it a while longer.
* I still struggle so much socially. I'm not even close to comfortable with the students or teachers yet - tho I'm getting better (even tho they're as lovely a bunch as could be. I'm just so... afraid). The networking event (thankfully obligatory, else I probably would have found some excuse) was trying, but very welcome, necessary, and helpful. I masochistically look forward to the next. Hopefully I can do better, or at least exposure-therapy myself a little more. All trials are successes.
* I did finally managed to connect with some of the other students, despite my...fear, shyness, shame, whatever. I cannot express how much that helps alleviate the weight. I am glad for whatever little closeness I have.
* I deeply admire Nyan's ability to just throw himself out there. Dude has it all, he's definitely going places.
* Andrew (the founder) took each of us for a walk-n-talk this week. He is remarkably invested in us as _people_, not just as students. I'm not sure anyone has ever been that directly interested in me before. His intensity is depply affecting.
* He really believes that I'm smart. I've never really known what to think about it. I can't be as smart as people think: smart people actually do things, accomplish things, have value. What have I ever done? And what visible traits make people think that anyway? Is it that I'm quiet? I'm just cripplingly shy and afraid and sad. If that's good for something, I sure as hell don't know what for.
* I'm not even sure what it means (to be smart). I'm never the most knowledgeable or skilled or capable person, so what are we pointing at? Learning speed? I'm ok at that, I guess. And thank god the concussion doesn't seem to have taken that away, at least not too much, else there'd be no hope at all. I was _really_ afraid of that. I still am. But do people notice that? I doubt it.
* Besides, I kinda question the frame: what good is smart if you can't do anything? Capacity without content is nothing. And as the saying goes, "if you're so smart, why aren't you happy?"
* I don't know.
* Andrew found it strange and funny that I'm so unambitious. I didn't really know what to say. He's right, it is odd. I think there's a major blockage of fear, fear of rejection, derision, preventing me admitting my desires to others, and to myself.
* He asked me about what I like, what I want, what I want to do. I didn't have any answers, and I still don't. He thinks I can do _anything_, so what the fuck do I even want?
* I loved hockey, but as meditation, not life. It thrills, it clears the mind, but does not engage it. Besides, the community is not one I'd choose to spend my life in.
* I'm realising these things are important to me: engaging the mind, and a good community. I want to be at my edge, I want to be at _the_ edge, and I want there to be a good, welcoming community there as well. Maybe this is too much to ask. Maybe we have to make the future we want. Maybe this is effectively what startup founders are doing, building a community they like at the edge of their and the world's capability.
* I loved working at that startup too, but I don't think there was something inherent about neuroscience or startups that appealed to me. I just liked that I was at the edge of what was possible (and, frankly, a little beyond it, wading into bullshit) and that I was for some reason valued by capable, knowledgeable people.
* I wonder if people sometimes attach to whatever problem is most salient in their environment - whether it affects them directly, or it's just important to their group. A capable person, affected by a problem, or surrounded by people engaging with it, takes it upon themselves, carries the torch. Me, by contrast, always on the outside, always fearfully holding myself apart, have never really attached anywhere. So I half-glom on to whatever nearby interesting problem offers me challenge and something approximating community. I think fear and loneliness and a lifetime of feeling unsafe are unfortunately the strongest motivators and shapers of my life. I wonder what would come out if those problems were solved. I have no idea. I have no idea who I am outside of all this fear and despair.
* But perhaps there's a lesson there: if love is so closely tied to attention, then I can choose what I love - I need only give it attention. So I should choose whatever I want. (Choose wisely.)
* I am unbelievably grateful to be here. Ever since that concussion knocked my ass out I've been trapped in an unscalable hole, slippery and deep. More alone than ever, and more afraid than I'd ever been before, more anxious and unsafe and despairing, I wallowed. For eight years I roiled in that miasma. I thought that it was over, that I'd lost my edge permanently, that I'd never be the same.
* And maybe I'm not, but I'm alright. What I'm learning most here at Fractal is that things are possible. Maybe anything.
