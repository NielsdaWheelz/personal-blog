* A harder week, and a better week.
* I feel like the quantity of stuff learned is less than the first week, but the quality is much greater. I feel imbued with immense capacity: any problem I come up against, with enough time breaking down the problem, eventually it is small enough that I can solve it. The feeling of being overwhelmed whenever I come across something new is significantly decreasing.
* I worry, however, that I am over-relying on LLMs. I don't copy code, but I definitely get a lot of help outlining the problem, breaking down the solution, learning what's possible and what's out there, and am still asking extremely basic questions. It is an _immense_ boon to be able to get feedback on my strategy before I even commit it to code; it saves an _ungodly_ amount of time.
* I think I just need more practice. Jahnik - wisely, I think - said that the difference between the good coders and the rest of us is that they've written 20x the code we have. Like everything else in life, it's mostly a volume game. Write more lines of code. More more more.
* It gets lonely, in a new city, surrounded by strangers. Wednesday the depression came back very hard, and disabled me all day. Thankfully, I was able to work through it a little that evening and Thursday morning, and the feeling of capability (from successfully achieving things) was enough to fend it off enough to continue. I'd never shaken it off that quickly before, I've not always been so lucky. The environment of Fractal pulls you in, makes it easier to lock in, to push yourself. That dark heavy weight is still there, but I can carry it a while longer. Connecting with some of the other students is a huge help too.
* I still struggle so much socially. I'm not even close to comfortable with the students or teachers yet - tho I'm getting better (it's hard not to, they're as lovely a bunch as could be). The networking event (thankfully obligatory, else I probably would have found some excuse) was trying, but very welcome, necessary, and helpful. I masochistically look forward to the next. Hopefully I can do better, or at least exposure-therapy myself a little more. All trials are successes.
* I deeply admire Nyan's ability to just throw himself out there. Dude has it all, he's definitely going places.
* Andrew (the founder) took each of us for a walk-n-talk this week. He is remarkably invested in us as _people_, not just as students. I'm not sure anyone has ever been that directly interested in me before. His intensity is affecting.
* He really seems to think I'm smart. I've never really known what to think about it. I'm certainly not as smart as people think: smart people actually do things, accomplish things - what have I done? And what visible traits make people think that anyway? Is it that I'm quiet? I'm just cripplingly shy and afraid. If that's good for something, I sure as hell don't know what for.
* I'm not even sure what it means (to be smart). I'm never the most knowledgeable or skilled person in any room, so what are we pointing at? Learning speed? Adaptation? I'm ok at that, I guess. And thank god the concussion doesn't seem to have taken that away, at least not too much. I was _really_ afraid of that; I still am. But that can't be what people see when they say that, one doesn't exactly notice that in casual conversation.
* Besides, I kinda question the frame: what good is smart if you can't do anything? Capacity without content is nothing. And as the saying goes, "if you're so smart, why aren't you happy?"
* I don't know. I've never been able to answer these questions. They've always bothered me, perhaps they always will.
* Andrew found it strange and funny that I'm so unambitious. I didn't really know what to say. He's right, it is odd. I think there's a major blockage of fear, fear of rejection, derision, preventing me admitting my desires to others, and to myself. 
* He asked me about what I like, what I want, what I want to do. I didn't have any answers, and I still don't. I can do _anything_, so what the fuck do I want?
* I loved hockey, but as meditation, not life. It thrills, it clears the mind, but does not engage it. Besides, the community is not one I'd choose to spend my life in.
* I'm realising these things are important to me: engaging the mind, and a good community. I want to be at my edge, I want to be at _the_ edge, and I want there to be a good, welcoming community there as well. Maybe this is too much to ask. Maybe we have to make the future we want. Maybe this is effectively what startup founders are doing, building a community they like at the edge of their and the world's capability.
* I loved working at that startup too, but I don't think there was something inherent about neuroscience or startups that appealed to me. I just liked that I was at the edge of what was possible (and a little beyond it, frankly, wading into the impossible) and that I was for some reason valued by capable, knowledgeable people.
* I wonder if people sometimes attach to whatever problem is most salient in their environment (whether it affects them directly, or it's just important to their group). A capable person, affected by a problem, or surrounded by people engaging with it, takes it upon themselves, carries the torch. Me, by contrast, always holding myself apart from fear, have never really attached anywhere. So I half-glom on to whatever nearby interesting problem which will offer me challenge and something approximating community. I think fear and loneliness and a desire for safety are far stronger motivators than I'd like to admit. I wonder what would come out if those problems were solved?
* But perhaps there's a lesson there: if love is so closely tied to attention, then I can choose what I love - I need only give it attention. So choose whatever you want, but choose wisely.
* I am unbelievably grateful to be here. Ever since that concussion knocked my ass out I've been trapped in an unscalable hole, slippery and deep. For eight years I thought that it was over, that I'd lost my edge permanently, that I'd never be the same.
* And maybe I'm not, but I'm alright so far. What I'm learning most here is that things are possible. Maybe anything.
